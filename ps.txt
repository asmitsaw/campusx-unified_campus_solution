National Institute of Technology (NIT Consortium) 
Unified Campus Super App (Web-Based Academic & Service Dashboard) 
Background & Organizational Context 
Across India, institutions like NITs, IITs, and large state universities operate multiple independent digital 
systems: 
 LMS portal 
 Attendance portal 
 Hostel management 
 Exam result portal 
 Placement system 
 Event registration site 
 Library database 
Students must: 
 Log into multiple platforms daily 
 Track deadlines manually 
 Switch interfaces repeatedly 
 Miss important notifications 
Faculty similarly use separate portals for: 
 Attendance upload 
 Result entry 
 Course materials 
The NIT Consortium proposes a Unified Campus Super App (Web-based prototype) to streamline academic 
and campus services under a single intelligent dashboard. 
Problem Statement 
Design and develop a centralized, role-based campus dashboard web application that consolidates: 
 Academic tracking 
 Attendance monitoring 
 Event notifications 
 Library status 
 Placement updates 
The solution must simulate integration of multiple campus services through modular design. 
Minimum Deliverables (12-Hour Scope) 
✔ Role-based authentication 
✔ Unified dashboard 
✔ Minimum 5 modules 
✔ Notification logic 
✔ Responsive UI 
Bonus: 
Backend API simulation.
